# Simulation of ice sheet range in Antarctica

Project made by me and my teammates [TomaszDabrowa](https://github.com/TomaszDabrowa) and [Ciegotura](https://github.com/Ciegotura) for studies for Modeling in Earth Sciences course.
Animation shows changes of ice sheet range in Antarctica from 1978 to 2009 with 20 days intervals.
